2. Basic knowledge about image.

2.1 RAW
RAW files are image files that contain uncompressed and unprocessed image data, allowing you to capture practically every 
detail seen from the camera image sensor. It thus requires more memory storage than JPEG, PNG, BMP, and TIFF files.

They are not yet processed and therefore are not ready to be printed, viewed or edited with a bitmap graphics editor.

2.2 TIFF
It is one kind of raw image.

Its first 2 bytes indicate the byte order of the image data:
0x49 0x49 indicate Little-Endian, and 0x4D 0x4D indicate Big-Endian.

The following 2 bytes are 0x002A for Little-Endian. If you view the data in hex format, it is "2A 00".
